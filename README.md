The blockchains that survive will be the ones people use. Furthermore, with the advent of AI the most successful blockchains will be those which optimize the human-AI web3-blockchain UI interactions.

Initially the [blockdocuments.org](blockdocuments.org) standard retail form UI operates on the XRP Ledger via Xaman (formerly Xumm) wallet API signing for a Wyoming Motor Vehicle Bill of Sale generating a PDF download with txhash links. Users have the option to record the PDFâ†’PNG-GIF converted images as Sologenic SOLO NFTs.

Users manually enter in the retail form {key:value} pairs, however with the advent of AI and the Oraichain LLM data sources, future development is conceivable to be practical along the lines of AI-prompted AI-transacted retail forms of public record.
