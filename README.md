# BlockDocuments.org

This [blockdocuments.org](blockdocuments.org) project is a Web3 user interface wherein users fill out standard retail forms with Xumm wallet signing of transactions on the XRP Ledger global blockchain, generating a PDF of the transaction instance with `txhash` links back to the blockchain. 

The present utility initiates with a Wyoming Motor Vehicle Bill of Sale, being one of the 16 states requiring a bill of sale. The workflow follows the traditional pattern where the buyer and seller verify the goods, each other's information, and agree on a price. They then sign the document with their Web3 wallets and if all looks good then the buyer transfers the funds same as it ever was.

Financial inclusion and unlocking XRP Ledger scaling is facilitated via the blockdocuments.org website requiring only a computer, phone, and moderate learning curve practice with microscopic transactions operating entirely through the browser via Javascript with the XRPL backend hence of lightest weight for the service provider networks.

Security involves refreshing the screen wiping out all the data, which only temporarily registers in users browsers to generate the PDF downloads.

The significance of the project towards CBDCs is it validates the global finance leaders optimism towards some unknown advancement in NFTs from their initial level of cultural memes to the level of an NFT data information field of AI quantum computer entangled superpositioned spin-states algorithmic interference patterns of microeconomic dynamics integrating into the macroeconomic algorithmic interference patterns of interest.
